How to use this app:
1. Make sure React, Node.js, and MySQL are installed
2. MySQL credentials (from server.js): user: root, password: password 
3. set up database in MySQL called "tasks" and set up a table using the script in show_create_tables
4. cd to client and api directories in separate terminals
5. use npm start to start server and client

Functionality of this app is nearly complete. Users can add tasks which are stored in the database. The only functionality I was not able to complete was displaying the user data in the frontend (I was still able to make a call to retrieve the task data all the way to front though)
